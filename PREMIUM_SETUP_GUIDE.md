- **Premium UI**: Dedicated premium unlock screen with purchase flow
- **Billing Integration**: Google Play Billing Library integration via Pyjnius

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:

### Modified Files:

## Google Play Console Setup

### 1. Create In-App Product

1. **Go to Google Play Console** → Your App → Monetize → Products → In-app products
2. **Create new product** with these details:
   - **Product ID**: `premium_unlock` (must match `billing_manager.py`)
   - **Name**: "Premium Content Unlock"
   - **Description**: "Unlock all lessons and premium features"
   - **Price**: €5.00
   - **Status**: Active

### 2. Configure App Permissions

Ensure your app manifest includes the billing permission (already added in `pyproject.toml`):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
```

### 3. Upload Signed APK

1. **Build signed APK**:
   ```bash
   flet build apk --build-mode=release
   ```

2. **Upload to Google Play Console** → Release → Production/Internal testing

3. **Wait for processing** (can take several hours)

### 4. Test In-App Purchases

#### Internal Testing:
1. **Add test accounts** in Play Console → Setup → License testing
2. **Join internal testing** via the provided link
3. **Install test version** from Play Store
4. **Test purchase flow** (will use sandbox billing)

#### Production Testing:
1. **Publish to production** or closed testing
2. **Test with real payment methods** (small amounts)
3. **Verify purchase persistence** across app restarts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Premium unlock card appears in home view
- [ ] Premium view loads without crashes
- [ ] Navigation between views works correctly

### ✅ Google Play Testing
- [ ] In-app product created and active in Play Console
- [ ] APK uploaded and processed successfully
- [ ] Test account can access the app
- [ ] Premium unlock button navigates to premium view
- [ ] Billing service connects (shows "Ready to purchase")

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Billing service unavailable"**
- Ensure device has Google Play Services
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify app is signed and uploaded to Play Console
- Confirm in-app product is active

**"Failed to start purchase"**
- Check product ID matches exactly (`premium_unlock`)
- Ensure billing permission is granted
- Verify Google Play Console setup is complete

**Purchase not persisting**
- Check local storage implementation in `billing_manager.py`
- Verify purchase verification logic
- Test with different devices/accounts

**Import errors**
- Ensure Pyjnius is properly installed for Android builds
- Check that all new files are included in the build
- Verify Python import paths are correct

## Security Considerations

1. **Purchase Verification**: The current implementation uses local storage for simplicity. For production, consider:
   - Server-side purchase verification
   - Receipt validation with Google Play Developer API
   - Encrypted local storage

2. **Product Security**: 
   - Obfuscate the APK to protect billing logic
   - Implement additional anti-piracy measures if needed
   - Monitor for unusual purchase patterns

## Revenue and Analytics

- **Track purchases** via Google Play Console → Financial reports
- **Monitor conversion rates** from free to premium users
- **Analyze user behavior** around the premium unlock feature
- **A/B test** different pricing or unlock strategies

## Support and Maintenance

- **Monitor user reviews** for billing-related issues
- **Keep Google Play Billing Library updated** via Pyjnius
- **Test purchases regularly** to ensure continued functionality
- **Provide clear support** for purchase-related user inquiries
